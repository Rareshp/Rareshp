Hi 👋 My name is Rareș
======================

I have been technical engineer and software trainer for Industrial Software, specifically AVEVA.
I am also expanding my knowledge in regards to developing software, not just using it.

- 🧠  I know AVEVA software such as:
  - AVEVA Edge (formerly Indusoft)
  - AVEVA InTouch
  - AVEVA Plant SCADA (formerly Citect)
  - AVEVA System Platform (Application Server, Historian, OMI)
  - AVEVA Reports (Dream Reports)
- 🧠  Bash warrior
- 🌱  I'm learning:
  - Python
  - Javascript (made a simple website in Astro)
  - SQL (Postgresql and Timescaledb; I mostly use Microsoft SQL for work)
- 🚀  I'm currently working on [Streamlit + Postgresql](http://github.com/Rareshp/python_streamlit_postgresql)
- 🤝  I'm open to collaborations
